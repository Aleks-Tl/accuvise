                <h5>8. What is Lawful Processing?</h5>
                <div>
                  <p>For the processing of data to be lawful under the GDPR and the DPA, there are certain conditions that need to be met before we can process personal data.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Under the DPA, we are allowed to hold and process your personal data on the following six legal bases:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>You consent to the processing for one or more specified purposes;</li>
                  <li>The processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or in order to take steps at your request before entering into a contract;</li>
                  <li>For compliance with any legal and regulatory obligations to which we are subject;</li>
                  <li>In order to protect your vital interests or another person;</li>
                  <li>For the performance of a task carried out in the public interest;</li>
                  <li>For the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party to whom data is disclosed, except if the processing is unwarranted in any particular case having regard to the harm and prejudice your rights and freedoms or legitimate interests.</li>
                </ul>
                <div>
                  <p>Some of the above mentioned grounds for processing might overlap and there might be more than ground substantiating our use of your personal data.</p>
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>9. What are the purposes for processing your data?</h5>
                <p>Pursuant to paragraph 8 of the Policy, we may process your personal data for the following purposes:</p>

                  <li>To disclose your personal data to any bank or third party financial institution;</li>
                  <li>To enforce or defend our rights, or those of third parties to whom we may delegate responsibilities in order to comply with a legal or regulatory obligations imposed on us;</li>

                </ul>
                <div>
                  <p>Your personal data will only be used for the purposes for which we collected it (as listed above) except in circumstances where we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. In case we might need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we shall notify you and explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>10. To whom we may disclose your personal data?</h5>
                <p>We may disclose your personal data:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>To authorities such as ROC, FSC, MRA and FIU for performance of a legal or regulatory requirement; </li>
                  <li>To third parties including but not limited to banks, financial institutions, legal professionals, auditors, IT service providers under the terms and conditions of a contractual arrangement or appropriate delegation.</li>
                </ul>

                </div>
                <div>
                  <p>In cases where such third parties act as data processors, we shall ensure that there is an appropriate agreement in place and that your personal data is processed according to applicable laws.</p>
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>11. How long do we keep hold of your data for?</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>Your personal data will be retained as long as required:</li>

                  <li>As required by other applicable laws or regulatory requirements.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>12. Limitation of Liability</h5>
                <div>
                  <p>We respect your privacy and your personal data is always treated diligently and cautiously by our organisation. We aim to store and process your personal data in accordance with accepted market standards.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <p>Whilst we have taken every reasonable care to ensure the implementation of appropriate technical and security measures, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal data over the internet, via email or via our website nor do we accept, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any liability for any errors in data transmission, machine, software or operating error or any other cause.</p>
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>13. Keeping in mind Your Rights as Data Subject</h5>
                <p>The DPA introduces greater rights for you as data subject so as to be aligned with the enhanced rights afforded under the GDPR. These are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Right of Access;</li>
                  <li>Right of Rectification;</li>
                  <li>Right of Erasure;</li>
                  <li>Right of Restriction; </li>
                  <li>Right to Object.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>What is Right of Access?</b></p>
                <div><p>It is your right to request a copy of the information that we hold about you. If you would like a copy of some or all of your processed personal data, please email or write to us at the address mentioned in paragraph 15.8. We will respond to your request within one month of receipt of the request.</p></div>
                <p><b>What is Right of Rectification?</b></p>
                <div><p>We want to make sure your personal information is accurate and up to date. You may ask us to correct data you think is inaccurate by emailing or writing to us.</p></div>
                <p><b>What is Right of Erasure?</b></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>You have the right to ask us to delete your personal data in the following course of events:</li>
                  <li>The data is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was collected or otherwise processed;</li>
                  <li>You withdraw your consent on which the processing is based and there is no other legal ground for processing;</li>
                  <li>You object to the processing of your personal data and there is no legitimate ground to override this objection;</li>
                  <li>Your personal data has been unlawfully processed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Right of restriction</b></p>
                <div>
                  <p>In some situations, this right gives an individual an alternative to requiring data to be erased; in others, it allows the individual to require data to be held in limbo whilst other challenges are resolved.</p>
                </div>
                <p>If personal data is ‘restricted’, then we may only store the data, and not process it by any means. You may ask us to restrict the processing of your personal data under the following circumstances:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>You give us consent;</li>
                  <li>The accuracy of the personal data is contested by an individual, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the data;</li>
                  <li>The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purpose of the processing, but the data subject requires them for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claim;</li>
                  <li>The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests the restriction of their use instead; </li>
                  <li>When an individual has objected to processing (based on legitimate interests), then the individual can require the data to be restricted whilst the controller verifies the grounds for processing.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Right to object</b></p>
                <p>You have a specific right to object. It is not an absolute right and it applies only in the following circumstances:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>When the processing of data falls in the category of direct marketing. In this case you can object at any time when your data is processed for direct marketing purposes.</li>
                  <li>You can object if your data is processed for research or statistical purposes. This time, objecting is not an absolute right as it can be overridden is the research is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.</li>
                  <li>If the data is processed based on public or legitimate interests, objection is possible. In this case, the controller will need to demonstrate it has compelling legitimate interest to process the data that override the data subject’s rights and freedoms.</li>
                  <li>However, if we have processed your personal data under lawful processing conditions mentioned in paragraph 10, and you choose to object, we might no longer be in a position in that case to continue providing our services to you.</li>
                  <li>You have a right at any time to stop us sending you newsletters, newsflash, important notices/ communiqué and general updates on the Mauritius and Global International Financial Services industry.</li>
